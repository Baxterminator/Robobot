  height: -1               # Custom height for the image
mode:
  device: 0                # The index of the camera (e.g. 0 for /dev/video0)
  co_s: 1.0                # The timeout before retrying to connect to the camera
  on_trigger: true         # True if the camera needs to be trigger for an image to be published
calibration:
  calib_width: 1080              # The width at which the calibration has been done

  calib_K: [1.0, 1.0, 540, 360]  # Matrix K coeffs (fx, fy, cx, cy) = transformation to camera frame
  calib_d: [0,0,0,0,0]           # Vector d coeffs = distortion (5 elems)
